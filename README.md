## 🧰 Tech Stack  

| Purpose | Technology / Tool |
|--------|------------------|
| Markup / Styles / Layout | HTML, CSS |
| Interactivity / Dynamics | JavaScript (or a framework/library if used) |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages |
| CI / CD / Automation | GitHub Actions  |
| Custom Domain & HTTPS | Custom domain  + GitHub Pages auto SSL |

## 🔧 Setup & Run Locally  

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/My-Portfolio.git
cd My-Portfolio

# (optional) If you use a build step (e.g. webpack / parcel / bundler):
# npm install
# npm run build
```
# Open index.html in browser to preview locally

💡 For live reload during development, use any static-server — e.g. npx live-server .

✅ Deployment

Push changes to main branch — GitHub Pages will auto-deploy on changes.

If using a custom domain: add your domain in “Settings → Pages → Custom domain”.

Ensure DNS records are set correctly (A records for root / CNAME for www).

GitHub will provision a free SSL certificate — enable Enforce HTTPS in Pages settings.
